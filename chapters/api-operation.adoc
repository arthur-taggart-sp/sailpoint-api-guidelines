[#192]
== {MUST} publish OpenAPI specification

All service applications must publish OpenAPI specifications of their external
APIs. While this is optional for internal APIs, i.e. APIs marked with the
*component-internal* <<219, API audience>> group, we still recommend to do so
to profit from the API management infrastructure.

IDN APIs are published from an internal GitHub repository.  All other APIs will
need to be submitted to the Developer Relations team for publishing.


[#193]
== {MUST} monitor API usage

Owners of APIs used in production should monitor API service to get
information about its using clients. This information, for instance, is
useful to identify potential review partner for API changes.

Hint: A preferred way of client detection implementation is by logging
of the client-id retrieved from the OAuth token.
