[#218]
== {MUST} contain API meta information
API specifications must contain the following OpenAPI meta information
to allow for API management:

- `#/info/title` as (unique) identifying, functional descriptive name of the API
- `#/info/version` to distinguish API specifications versions following
  <<116, semantic rules>>
- `#/info/description` containing a proper description of the API
- `#/info/x-audience` intended target audience of the API (<<219, see rule 219>>)

[NOTE]
====
We’ll automatically generate `#/info/contact/*` when creating public Open API spec.

[#116]
== {MUST} use semantic versioning

OpenAPI allows to specify the API specification version in
`#/info/version`. To share a common semantic of version information we
expect API designers to comply to http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html[
Semantic Versioning 2.0] rules `1` to `8` and `11` restricted to the format
<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH> for versions as follows:

* Increment the **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
after having aligned this changes with consumers,
* Increment the **MINOR** version when you add new functionality in a
backwards-compatible manner, and
* Optionally increment the **PATCH** version when you make
backwards-compatible bug fixes or editorial changes not affecting the
functionality.

*Additional Notes:*

* *Pre-release* versions (http://semver.org#spec-item-9[rule 9]) and
*build metadata* (http://semver.org#spec-item-10[rule 10]) must not
be used in API version information.
* While patch versions are useful for fixing typos etc, API designers
are free to decide whether they increment it or not.
* API designers should consider to use API version `0.y.z`
(http://semver.org/#spec-item-4[rule 4]) for initial API design.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: Parcel Service API
  description: API for <...>
  version: 1.3.7
  <...>
----

[NOTE]
====
We’ll automatically generate the global `#/info/version` when creating public Open API spec. 
Each individual endpoint spec author need not worry about this attribute.

[#219]
== {MUST} provide API audience

Each API must be classified with respect to the intended target audience 
supposed to consume the API, to facilitate differentiated standards on APIs 
for discoverability, changeability, quality of design and documentation, as 
well as permission granting. We differentiate the following API audience 
groups with clear organizational and legal boundaries: 

`internal-company`
`external-public`

[NOTE]
====
This is only for documentation generation purposes and not related to 
authorization—authz concerns must be addressed with normal policies.
====

[source,yaml]
----
/info/x-audience:
  type: string
  x-extensible-enum:
    - internal-company
    - external-public
  description: |
    Intended target audience of the API. Relevant for standards around
    quality of design and documentation, reviews, discoverability,
    changeability.
----

[NOTE]
====
Exactly one audience per API specification is allowed. For this reason 
a smaller audience group is intentionally included in the wider group 
and thus does not need to be declared additionally. If parts of your API 
have a different target audience, we recommend to split API specifications 
along the target audience — even if this creates redundancies (rationale (internal link)).

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  x-audience: internal-company
  title: Service to Service API
  description: API for <...>
  version: 1.2.4
  <...>
