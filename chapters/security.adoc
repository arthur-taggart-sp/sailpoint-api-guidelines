[#104]
== {MUST} secure endpoints with OAuth 2.0

Every public API endpoint must be secured using OAuth 2.0.

The following code snippet shows how to define the authorization scheme using a bearer token (e.g. JWT token).

[source,yaml]
----
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
----

The next code snippet applies this security scheme to all API endpoints. The bearer token of the client must have additionally the scopes scope_1 and scope_2.

[source,yaml]
----
security:
  - BearerAuth: [ scope_1, scope_2 ]
----


[#105]
== {MUST} define and assign permissions (scopes)

Each endpoint must document every https://github.com/sailpoint/cloud-api-client-common/blob/master/api-specs/src/main/yaml/beta/securitySchemes/OAuth2.yaml[AMS right, role=external, window=_blank] 
needed to access the endpoint.  If creating a new AMS right that doesnâ€™t exist in the list, then it must be added to the list first.

To appropriately document AMS rights on an endpoint, use the following OpenAPI properties:
[source,yaml]
----
security:
  - bearerAuth:
     - 'idn:task-definition:read'
     - 'idn:task-definition:write'
----

A full example on an endpoint might look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
get:
  tags:
    - tenants
  summary: Get Tenant
  description: Get tenant object based on current auth token
  operationId: getTenant
  responses:
    '200':
      description: successful operation
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '../schemas/Tenant.yaml'
  security:
    - bearerAuth:
        - 'cam:general:read'

[#306]
== {MUST} Document necessary license add-on to use an API collection

If an API collection requires additional product licenses to enable the feature, then each required license must be documented in the API collection description.


[#225]
== {MUST} follow naming convention for permissions (scopes)
